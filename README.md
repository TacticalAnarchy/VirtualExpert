# Virtual Assistant
This virtual assistant is a site designed to help you find the products that best suit the customers needs while providing a wealth of knowledge for more informed decisions
## What It Is
All smart home products are software driven. This fact makes the features and benefits of each product hard to find, compare, explain and demonstrate.
The virtual assistant is a tool to help easily identify and gain extensive information about the products that meet the customers criteria.

If the customer has a product in mind, you can use the search function to find the product and gain access to the information directly.

Every product has;
- In-depth summary
- Quick Features and Drawbacks
- Customer Support information
- Similar products
- SKU

## How it works
Using a uniquely interactive filter, you can dwindle down your search to a few products. This ensures you're only looking at what's relevant.
Once you have a selection, there is a wealth of knowledge for each product right at your fingertips to help make more informed decisions on what works for the customer.

Using Vue JS, a large database of information and our branching filter we can quickly and effectively find the best options for customers.

## Reports and Suggestions
This project will be forever evolving. As new products are added or removed, and we understand that things dont always go smoothly.

If you run into any issues, Please use the report tool to explain what happened.
There is also a suggestion tab to help add or correct information about a product
